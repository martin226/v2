# Shipping a Presentation Generator in 3 Days

<Image src={SlideItIn} alt="Slide It In" />

A few days ago, I was studying for my CS 146 midterm, which I should be doing right now instead of writing this....

Anyways, I was reading through some of the lecture notes, and I thought to myself: "Wouldn't it be nice if I could read slides instead of boring walls of text?"

My friend Pranav posted this tweet a few weeks ago about how he makes slideshows on research:

<ThemedTweet id="1878654750801141793" />

This part of the tweet really resonated with me:

> personally find slideshows easier to comb through than pages of notes

That gave me an idea. What if I could take a document, or multiple documents, and convert it into a slideshow?

I thought it would be a fun project to work on over the next couple of days. Who cares about the midterm anyways?

As for the name of the project, I'll let you guess why I chose "Slide it In". ([definitely not this](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dih-to-yo-crack-slide-that-shi-in-gng-%F0%9F%92%94))

## The Plan

Before writing a single line of code, I needed to make some fundamental decisions about the architecture. I wanted a modern, responsive web application with an elegant, easy-to-use interface, as well as a blazingly fast backend.

Not long ago, I made [Make it Jake's](https://jakesresu.me), a website that takes in a resume and converts it to Jake's Resume template. Uploading documents, processing, and returning a result... sound familiar? Software design patterns are a beautiful thing.

I built Make it Jake's with Ruby on Rails, Remix.js, and Redis, so I thought it would be a fun challenge to make Slide it In with Go, Next.js, and Firestore.

### Tech Stack Selection

For the frontend, I chose:
- **Next.js 14**: For its excellent developer experience, built-in routing, and server-side rendering capabilities
- **TypeScript**: To add type safety and improve code quality
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid UI development with utility classes
- **Framer Motion**: To add polished animations and transitions

For the backend, I went with: \*
- **Go (Gin framework)**: For its performance, simplicity, and strong concurrency support
- **Google Cloud Firestore**: As a scalable, serverless database for job storage
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash API**: For AI-powered content generation
- **Marp**: For converting markdown to presentation slides

\* there's something missing here, but I'll get to that later

Marp is the backbone of the project. It's a markdown-based presentation tool that allows you to write in markdown and convert it to a presentation. It's a great tool for quickly creating presentations, and it's what I used to turn the slide-by-slide notes into an actual visual presentation.

## Building the Frontend Experience

I wanted the user experience to be intuitive, visually appealing, and responsive. The frontend needed to guide users through a multi-step process while providing real-time feedback.

### Simple, Beautiful Landing Page

My mental model around UX design is that cognitive load is the enemy. The more steps there are to complete a task, the more cognitive load there is. The more cognitive load there is, the more likely the user is to give up.

I wanted the landing page to be simple yet beautiful, and I wanted it to be a good fit for the overall theme of the project.

The landing page has a single clear action (Upload Documents), under an equally clear call to action. There's nothing to think about, and the user can just click the button and get started.

<Image src={SlideItIn} alt="Landing Page" />

I used an amber color palette for the project, and I think it looks pretty good. It's similar to the color of a pencil, which is a nice touch. For coherence, I made the background a notepad texture.

If you scroll down, you'll see a section on use cases.

<Image src={UseCases} alt="Use Cases" />

Sometimes, users don't think of all the ways that a project can be useful. My goal with this section was to help users self-identify the problem they're experiencing and how Slide it In can help.

### The Flow-Based UI

I designed the application around a step-by-step flow that breaks down what could be a complex process into manageable pieces:

1. **Theme Selection**: Users choose a visual theme for their presentation
2. **File Upload**: Users upload their documents (PDF, Markdown, or TXT)
3. **Settings Configuration**: Users customize audience type and detail level
4. **Processing**: The system generates the presentation with real-time progress updates
5. **Result**: Users preview and download their generated presentation

Splitting the process into 5 discrete steps makes it feel more manageable. It also allows me to give the user immediate feedback after each step.

<Image src={Flow} alt="Flow" />

I put extra attention into the transitions between steps, using Framer Motion to create smooth animations that make the experience feel cohesive. I've found that small details like these can really elevate the overall user experience.

### Real-Time Progress Updates

One of the first features I implemented was providing real-time updates during the presentation generation process. Since this process could take anywhere from 15 seconds to a few minutes depending on document size, I needed a way to keep users informed about the progress.

I had built something similar in [Make it Jake's](https://jakesresu.me), so I had some experience to draw from. 

Just like in Make it Jake's, I went with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for a unidirectional communication channel from server to client. It's simpler than WebSockets and perfectly suited for this kind of status streaming:

```typescript
// Simplified version of the status streaming implementation
const fetchStatus = async (jobId: string) => {
  const eventSource = new EventSource(`${API_BASE_URL}/v1/slides/${jobId}`);
  
  eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    setStatus(data.status);
    setProgress(data.progress);
    
    if (data.status === "completed" || data.status === "failed") {
      eventSource.close();
      if (data.status === "completed") {
        onComplete({ resultUrl: data.resultUrl });
      }
    }
  };
  
  eventSource.onerror = () => {
    eventSource.close();
    setError("Connection lost. Please refresh to check status.");
  };
};
```

This approach worked well, allowing users to see real-time updates as their presentation was being generated.

### PDF Rendering

One of the biggest challenges I faced was rendering the PDF in the frontend. I wanted to use the same PDF viewer that I used in Make it Jake's, but it didn't work well because some styles were not being applied correctly for Safari (damn it Apple).

I originally was going to keep the buggy viewer and just add a warning to Safari users, but this seemed hacky and I wanted to actually fix the issue.

An easy fix would be to just render an iFrame with the PDF route, but I didn't like how the native PDF viewer looked when embedded in a small container.

Instead, I decided to return the slides not only as a PDF, but also as an HTML file. The HTML file is created by Marp, and it contains built-in controls and a presenter view.

I updated the backend service to render the HTML file in the results route when `?download=false`, and I modified the Result component in the frontend to display an iFrame with the result URL.

<Image src={Rendering} alt="Rendering" />

Problem solved.

## Designing the Backend Architecture

The backend is where the work actually happens. It needed to handle document processing, AI content generation, and slide rendering efficiently.

Remember how I said there's something missing from the tech stack? I'll get to that now.

### Job Queue System

One of the key architectural decisions was implementing a job queue system. Since presentation generation is an asynchronous process, I needed a way to manage jobs, track their status, and deliver results when ready. It wouldn't be a good UX if the server didn't respond until the entire process was complete.

I decided to create my own job queue system using Firestore as the persistence layer. 

I started off with something like this:

```go
// Simplified version of the queue service
type Service struct {
    firestoreClient *firestore.Client
    slideService    slides.Service
}

func (s *Service) AddJob(ctx context.Context, job *models.Job) (string, error) {
    // Generate a unique ID for the job
    job.ID = uuid.New().String()
    job.Status = "queued"
    job.CreatedAt = time.Now()
    
    // Save the job to Firestore
    _, err := s.firestoreClient.Collection("jobs").Doc(job.ID).Set(ctx, job)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    
    // Process the job asynchronously
    go s.processJob(context.Background(), job)
    
    return job.ID, nil
}
```

This approach allowed the API to respond immediately with a job ID, while the actual processing happened asynchronously.

Okay, looks good, right?

Well, not exactly.

A side effect of this is that I can't assign jobs to specific Cloud Run instances. This wasn't a problem for Make it Jake's, because resume conversion is much less RAM intensive than presentation generation, which involves headless browser rendering.

When I tried queuing up 10 jobs simultaneously, the server took much longer than expected to process them, since it was using a single instance. Uh oh.

Enter Cloud Tasks.

Cloud Tasks is a job queue system that is fully managed by Google Cloud. It allows me to assign jobs to specific Cloud Run instances separate from the API service, and it also supports retries and backoff.

I moved all of the slide generation logic to a new microservice, and modified the queue service to use Cloud Tasks to send jobs to the microservice.

The microservice is a simple Go application that listens for jobs from Cloud Tasks and processes them. I set a concurrency limit of 1, which means that Cloud Run will spin up a new instance of the microservice to handle each job.

This also let me reduce the memory limit of the API service, since it wasn't needed anymore.

Now I have a bunch of buzzwords to throw around, like "scalable", "distributed", and "microservices".

Oh, and it worked like a charm.

### AI Content Generation with Gemini

The core of Slide It In is the AI content generation powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash. The prompt engineering system was probably the most challenging part of the project to get right.

#### Modular Prompt Engineering System

This part took a lot of trial and error. I went through many iterations of the prompt templates before finding an approach that worked consistently. The breakthrough came when I shifted from have a single prompt to using a modular system.

My system uses Go's `text/template` package to assemble different prompt components:

```go
// Generate theme example
themeExample, err := generateThemeExample(theme)
if err != nil {
    return "", err
}

// Create template data
data := map[string]interface{}{
    "Theme":        theme,
    "ThemeExample": themeExample,
    "DetailLevel":  detailPrompt,
    "Audience":     audiencePrompt,
}

// Parse and execute the template
tmpl, err := template.New("slidePrompt").Parse(slideGenerationTemplate)
if err != nil {
    return "", err
}
```

The system includes several key components:

1. **Theme-Specific Instructions**: Each visual theme (Default, Beam, Rose Pine, Gaia, Uncover, Graph Paper) has its own configuration with parameters that affect slide layout, formatting, and classes:

```go
// Theme configurations
var themeConfigs = map[string]map[string]interface{}{
    "default": {
        "UseLeadClass":    true,
        "HasInvertClass":  true,
        "HasTinyTextClass": false,
        "HasTitleClass":   false,
        "HeaderLocation":  "(top left of the slide)",
        "FooterLocation":  "(bottom left of the slide)",
        "ThemeDescription": "By default, the color scheme for each slide is light.",
    },
    "beam": {
        "UseLeadClass":    false,
        "HasInvertClass":  false,
        "HasTinyTextClass": true,
        "HasTitleClass":   true,
        // Additional configuration...
    },
    // Other themes...
}
```

2. **Detail Level Prompts**: The system constructs different prompts based on the user's selected detail level (detailed, medium, minimal):

   - **Detailed**: Extracts comprehensive content with all key information and supporting details, creates more slides to accommodate depth
   - **Medium**: Focuses on main concepts and key supporting details, consolidates related information
   - **Minimal**: Extracts only the most essential information, focusing on key conclusions and critical data points

3. **Audience-Targeted Prompts**: The system adapts the prompt based on the target audience:

   - **General**: Uses accessible language, includes brief definitions, emphasizes broader context
   - **Academic**: Preserves methodological details, citations, and theoretical frameworks
   - **Technical**: Maintains technical terminology, implementation details, and code examples
   - **Professional**: Highlights practical applications, actionable insights, and business relevance
   - **Executive**: Focuses on strategic implications, outcomes, ROI, and high-level recommendations

Early in development, I tried using a single generic prompt template. The results varied wildly in quality. Adding structure to the prompts and tailoring them to specific parameters significantly improved consistency.

## Deployment and Infrastructure

### GCP Fully Serverless Architecture

The entire Slide It In application runs on a GCP serverless infrastructure, which offers several advantages:

1. **Automatic Scaling**: The system scales up during peak usage and down during quiet periods without any manual intervention.
2. **Pay-per-Use Pricing**: I only pay for the resources I actually use, rather than provisioning servers that might sit idle.
3. **No Infrastructure Management**: No need to worry about server maintenance, security patches, or scaling configurations.

### Cloud Run

Both the frontend and backend services (including the slides microservice) are deployed as containers on Google Cloud Run, a fully managed platform for containerized applications.

All I had to do was write `Dockerfile`s, and then create a `cloudbuild.yaml` file to deploy the containers.

### Cloud Tasks

As I mentioned earlier, I moved the slide generation logic to its own Cloud Run service, and modified the queue service to use Cloud Tasks to create jobs.

This was a great move, because it allowed me to scale the slide generation service independently of the API service.

### Firestore as a Serverless Database

Google Cloud Firestore serves as the serverless database for storing job metadata and status. Its real-time updates capability is particularly useful for the status tracking feature:

1. **Real-time Updates**: Firestore's real-time listeners allow the backend to immediately react to job status changes, which can come from either of the two services.
2. **No Connection Management**: No need to worry about database connection pools or scaling
3. **Document-based Structure**: Perfect fit for our job metadata structure

I also used Firestore to temporarily store the final presentation for download. There are better ways to do this, such as using a storage bucket, but I wanted to keep the system simple and cost-effective. I used TTL indexes to automatically delete the presentation after 1 hour.

## justslideitin.com

This was probably one of the most fun projects I've worked on. Learning about the GCP serverless stack and building out a basic cloud-native application was a great experience, and I'm really happy with how everything turned out.

The project is fully open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/martin226/slideitin). Give it a star 🙏!
